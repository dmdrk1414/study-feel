My month was just normal
I started living near the school
I slept at school, so  I had a lot of work to do
My concern these days is a ghost
I think I saw a ghost about three times
There's someone standing at the end of the hall around 3:00 A.M
so it is time to go to bed if i saw her
So this month was so much fun  There's been a lot of work.

Seriously? 정말?  It could be my misunderstanding 나의 착각일수 있다

I think you liked the piano, right? 히부리사키?

That's all I remember. I think it's been so long
