# airticle DAY 날 사용할 스크립트를 제작중입니다.

재미있는 동아리 시간!

저는 테슬라에 관해 관심이 많아요 그래서

FSD에 관한 기사를 가져왔네요.

Elon Musk claims that Tesla has not had a single crash in its Full Self-Driving Beta program

since the start over a year ago,

but that’s just as much proof

that the testers are being careful as a proof that the system is safe.

The software enables the vehicle to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system,

but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times.

Tesla started the program in October 2020,
and it has now pushed the software to several thousands of customers.

The test program has been criticized for putting advanced autonomous features in the hands of customers

and leaving the responsibility
with them by calling it a level two autonomous system in Beta testing
